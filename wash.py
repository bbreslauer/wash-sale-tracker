    If there is only one lot bought on the first such day, then that is

    If there are multiple lots bought on the first such day, then the one sold
    earliest is chosen. If there are multiple lots bought and sold on the same
    day, then the first lot by form position is chosen. For this reason, it is
    best to set a unique form position for each input line.

    If a potential replacement lot is sold before the loss lot is sold, that
    potential replacement lot is not considered. The reason for this is that it
    can push a loss arbitrarily far in the past, which means that it would be
    possible that subsequent year's tax returns would need to be amended. This
    seems wrong, so we don't allow for it. But there doesn't seem to be any IRS
